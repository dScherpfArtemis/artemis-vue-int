# Session 1 - Featured Recipes

## Task - Create a featured recipes display

### Create a 3 card layout with these features:

-   Title
-   Meal and rating tags
-   Ingredients list
-   Link to the source (if available)
-   A preview of the first step

Your featured recipe component can be placed on the home page below the HelloWorld component, and should accept the recipe data as a prop from the HomePage component. For additional practice, consider breaking the layout in to reusable components where it makes sense (e.g. RecipeCard.vue, RatingTag.vue).

### Vue principles used in this session:

-   Reactivity (ref)
-   Attribute binding
-   Props (and component nesting)
-   Composition API
-   v-if (conditional rendering)
-   v-for (list rendering)
