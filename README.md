# Vue learning group project - Whim

## What have I made?

I like to cook. So much that I hardly ever circle back to the recipes I've made in the past, and I end up wondering what I've made. Let's build a little site to help solve that issue.

Each session we'll take a look at what we've built and talk through any issues we had. Then we'll set a goal for the next session.
